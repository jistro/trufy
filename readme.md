# Trufy: Expertise-Based Governance for DAOs

## Overview

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) face a critical challenge in their governance: Sybil attacks. In these attacks, malicious actors create multiple fake identities to manipulate votes and proposals, a risk that intensifies when decisions require specialized knowledge and voters lack experience in the subject area. This vulnerability can result in uninformed decisions, loss of resources, and potential exploitation of the DAO.

## Solution

Trufy has developed an innovative area-based credential system that ensures governance is grounded in verifiable expertise. The solution is built on three fundamental pillars that work together to create a robust and reliable ecosystem.

### 1. Comprehensive Credential Integration

The system aggregates data from reputable protocols such as Gitcoin Passport and Talent Passport, complementing them with objective metrics including:

* GitHub contributions
* Verified work experience
* Professional certifications

This multidisciplinary approach allows for the evaluation of specific competencies across various areas, from software development to marketing and finance.

### 2. Transparent Rating System

Our rating system uses flexible scales to quantify knowledge levels:

* Numerical scores (0-100)
* Letter grades (S, A, B, C)

This allows for precise granularity in expertise evaluation. For example, a developer with an "S" rating in computer science would naturally carry more weight in technical decisions than someone with a "C" rating.

### 3. Flexible Implementation for DAOs

Each DAO has the autonomy to decide how to implement and apply expertise metrics in their governance. While we recommend quadratic voting for optimal results, DAOs can customize their approach based on their specific needs:

* Choose their own voting mechanisms
* Set custom weight multipliers
* Define specialized requirements for different proposal types
* Implement varied voting thresholds

Our recommended approach using quadratic voting allows for:
* Dynamic vote value adjustment based on expertise
* Fair balance between influence and participation
* Protection against voting power concentration
* Enhanced collective decision-making

## Features

### Inclusive Participation

* Group ratings for protocols, companies, and teams
* Customizable DAO rules
* Flexible minimum multipliers per area
* Specific proposal requirements

### Security & Transparency

* Verifiable credential system
* Protection against identity manipulation
* Clear expertise evaluation metrics
* Transparent voting weight calculation

## Impact

Trufy delivers multiple benefits:

* More informed decision-making through verified expert opinions
* Reduced risk of manipulation and attacks
* Equitable governance balancing technical meritocracy with inclusivity
* Enhanced DAO security
* Promotion of transparency and accountability

## Vision

Trufy aims to revolutionize DAO governance by establishing a system where validated knowledge becomes the foundation of decentralized decision-making, creating more secure and effective autonomous organizations.
